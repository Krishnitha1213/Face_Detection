# Face_Detection

Face Detection Project

This Python project leverages OpenCV to detect human faces in images. It employs a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for efficient face recognition

Face Detection: The code utilizes the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml classifier to identify frontal human faces in the input image.
Rectangle Drawing: Detected faces are visually highlighted by drawing green rectangles around them on the original image.
Image Display (Colab Specific): The project is designed for use within a Google Colab environment. The cv2_imshow function displays the image with drawn rectangles within the notebook interface.
